# boilerplate-node-BJNW-babel-jest-no-wepback
A boilerplate to quickly bootstrap your next experiment Node project. When you only need Babel (to use import, async), Jest, and don't require Webpack yet.


## Why?
If, like me, you're prone to random ideas hitting you throughout the week and sometimes you want to flesh something out before inspiration flys away. You might also find yourself constantly creating the same files and installing the same packages, well, not anymore!

Specifically for ideas that involve node runtime, where you want to use the latest ES6 syntax and where you don't need all that extra config from Webpack just to play around with your idea. Just clone, and start coding.


## What can I do?
Check out the "scripts" portion of the ```package.json``` file.

You can write **Jest** test files with **ES6** syntax.
```
npm run test
```

Don't have any tests ? You can also run your **JS** file directly.
```
npm run execute-file example/index.js
```
